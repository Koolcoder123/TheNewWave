      <h1>Big changes to the NWSP</h1>
      <p>The NWSP is no longer a open party. We are making the party private to help the friend group that made it happen. And their friends. The party will be used to get a room in highschool. This room will be used as a locker room and may have a computer in it. 
      And I will be a general place fro the friend group to hangout in.</p>
