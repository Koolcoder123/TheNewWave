  <h1>The New Wave Student Party</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The NWSP or the New Wave Student Party is a student party that is made to aid a group of friends. out friends. This means it will be a point of unity and in Highschool we will attempt to get a room in the school. This room can be used as a locker room and a
  general place to hangout. (there are other clubs that do that. You never heard of them because they don't invite anyone. A private club.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Is there any benifits?</h2>
  <p>Yes, like the before mentioned locker room there is also plans to get a windows 10 pc in the room. The thing is windows 10 will be out of date and dangerous to use with internet. (What are we going to do? Use the SCHOOL INTERNET?) Games could be installed or 
  programs that could help with certain tags. Watching stuff. Storing stuff. And doing other stuff. (Idk I really can't tell how things will be in late 2025 and early 2026.</p>
  <h2>Who is the leader?</h2>
<p>The NWSP is mainly led by two people. Jaden Stanwick and Owen Chick. Other members can play a part in leading but those two mainly lead the party. The goal of the party is to get Jaden and Owen to student president
and student vice president. Other student goverment figures can run through our party aswell. </p>

  <h3>Current programs in our party</h3>
  <p>Our current party really needs funding to do much of anything. Occasionally the group will have snack days at lunch were one of us will buy snacks for the others. And sometimes meetings will take place during recess.
  This party is mostly a debating society. That is a group were one brings up a problem and the others give a answer.</p>
