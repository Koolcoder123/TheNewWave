  <h1>The New Wave Student Party</h1>
  <br>
  <p>The NWSP or the New Wave Student Party is a student party that is made to aid a group of friends. out friends. This means it will be a point of unity and in Highschool we will attempt to get a room in the school. This room can be used as a locker room and a
  general place to hangout. (there are other clubs that do that. You never heard of them because they don't invite anyone. A private club.</p>
  <br>
  <h2>Is there any benifits?</h2>
  <p>Yes, like the before mentioned locker room there is also plans to get a windows 10 pc in the room. The thing is windows 10 will be out of date and dangerous to use with internet. (What are we going to do? Use the SCHOOL INTERNET?) Games could be installed or 
  programs that could help with certain tags. Watching stuff. Storing stuff. And doing other stuff. (Idk I really can't tell how things will be in late 2025 and early 2026.</p>
  <h2>Who is the leader?</h2>
<p>The NWSP is mainly led by Jaden Stanwick and Owen is the vice president. This is mainly because we created the club. (Owen did not "create" the club, but played a great role in helping it.) Other than that everyone in the club is generally on the same level
of power. We might have votes when it may be needed.</p>
