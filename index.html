 <h3>Current programs in our party</h3>
  <p>Our current party really needs funding to do much of anything. Occasionally the group will have snack days at lunch were one of us will buy snacks for the others. And sometimes meetings will take place during recess.
  This party is mostly a debating society. That is a group were one brings up a problem and the others give a answer.</p>
